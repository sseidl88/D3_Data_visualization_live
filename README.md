# Visualizing Data with D3.js
Stock Prediction Challenge by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/sEpRzyPRH0sY).

## Overview

This is the code for the "Data Visualization with D3.js" live stream by @Sirajology on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sEpRzyPRH0s). The code uses the [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library as well as the [Dimple](http://dimplejs.org/) wrapper around it to visualize the Titanic Survivor Dataset using both a bar chart and a pie chart. This runs as a [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) web app.
